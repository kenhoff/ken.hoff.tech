						Before we begin, you'll need some tools:
					</h3>
					<ol>
						<li><b>A browser</b> (Chrome is best, Firefox is fine)</li>
						<li><b>A command line</b> (Terminal on Mac, cmd.exe/Powershell on PC)</li>
						<li><b>A text editor</b> (I use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, whatever you're comfortable with works too. Even Notepad!)</li>
						<li><b>Node.js</b> (If you haven't done so, <a href="https://nodejs.org/">go download it now!</a> <span class="muted">Should already be installed on the lab computers</span>)</li>

					<h3>a little about Ken Hoff (that's me!)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>CU Boulder, Computer Science, 2013</li>
						<li>Microsoft 2014-2016-ish</li>
						<li>Do some web dev consulting through <a href="https://hoff.tech">hoff.tech</a></li>
						<li>Working on Barfly - helps bars order liquor every week</li>
						<li>Teach web dev classes at <a href="http://sparkboulder.com/">Spark Boulder</a></li>
						<li>First computer memory that I have: Playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISP9su7okHo">Beyond Dark Castle</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_512Ke">Mac 512k</a> with my dad (that guy who teaches this
							class)</li>

					<h3>I'm a web developer!</h3>
					<p>
						Here's a couple of dumb fun things that I've built:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://hoff.tech">Hoff.tech</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://harderbetterfasteripsum.hoff.tech/">Daft Punk Lorem Ipsum</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://tsa-randomizer.hoff.tech/">The TSA Randomizer App</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Not strictly web dev, but I grade the students in my web dev classes using a Slack bot - code here: <a href="https://github.com/kenhoff/grader">https://github.com/kenhoff/grader</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Barfly helps bars order liquor every week - still in private beta, so I can't really share source code. It keeps track of all bars, sales reps, and liquor products in the state of Colorado, and routes text message orders between them.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h3>How is a web app different from a mobile app?</h3>
					<p>
						A <strong>mobile app</strong> is downloaded once from an app store, stored on the phone, and periodically recieves updates. Generally written in Java (Android) or Objective-C/Swift(iOS).
					</p>
					<p>
						A <strong>mobile web app</strong> is served over HTTP, and used within the browser. Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's basically the difference between the <strong>Facebook app</strong> on your phone, and <strong>mobile.facebook.com</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						It's faster and easier to update a <strong>mobile web app</strong>, and you only have to develop a single app that varies slightly between browsers. However, <strong>mobile apps</strong> get access to all of the native, speedy UI and
						computational
						power that the OS has.
					</p>

					<h3>How to be a web developer:</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Look stuff up on the internet</li>
						<li>Make stuff</li>
						<li>Repeat</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>A (very) brief history of web development</h3>
					<p>
						The very first website: <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html</a> (1989)
					</p>
					<p>
						Now we have stuff like this: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/</a> (2015)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Let's be web developers too!</h3>
					<p>
						Checking in - any questions? Everybody have a browser? What about a command line? What about a text editor? Everybody get Node.js installed alright?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Let's write some HTML</h3>
					<p>
						First, create a new directory (folder) where we're going to host your site. (something like <code>your_name_here_site</code> is just fine)
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						(Put in, like, the Desktop or something, because that's always a good place to keep stuff)
					</p>
					<p>
						Create a new file in that folder titled <code>index.html</code>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						In <code>index.html</code>, write:
						<pre>
						<code data-trim data-noescape>&lt;h1&gt;asdfasdfasdf&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
					</pre> and save it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Open index.html in a browser.
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						(You can double-click it in the Finder/Explorer, or Ctrl-O in a browser)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>yay!</h3>
					<img src="http://replygif.net/i/549.gif" alt="" />

				<section>
					<h3>
						Next step: Get that **** on The Internet
					</h3>
					<p>
						Your magnum opus isn't worth anything if people can't read it online!
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's put your page on <a href="http://firebase.com/">Firebase</a>.
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						Firebase is a service by Google that gives us free static site hosting.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Open a command line!
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						Terminal on Mac, cmd.exe on Windows
					</p>
					<p>
						Question: how familiar are people with the command line?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						On your command line, run <code>npm install firebase-tools -g</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're using one of the lab computers, you'll also need to create a path to the "npm" folder:
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code>
Click on “start”, type “envi”, select “Edit environment variables for your account”
Create a PATH variable with this value:
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						Once it's done installing, run <code>firebase login</code>
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						It's going to take you to a login screen - go ahead and log in with your google account.
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						Follow all the steps to create your account, then go back to the command line.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						On the command line, change your current directory to the project directory that we created earlier.
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						If you're on Mac/Linux, use <code>cd foo</code> to change to the foo directory and <code>pwd</code> to see what directory you're in. Use <code>ls</code> to see what's in that directory.
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						If you're on Windows, use <code>cd foo</code> to change to the foo directory and <code>cd</code> to see what directory you're in. Use <code>dir</code> to see what's in that directory.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once you're in your project directory (use <code>ls</code>/<code>dir</code> to be sure!) run <code>firebase init</code>.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						<code>firebase init</code> is going to ask you a couple questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						For "What Firebase do you want to use?", just choose the Firebase that's already created for you. <span class="muted">Should be something like <code>blistering-torch-1337</code></span>
					</p>
					<p>
						For "What directory should be the public root?", type <code>.</code> (the period character) and hit enter.
					</p>
					<p>
						It should say "Firebase initialized, configuration written to firebase.json".
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Next, run <code>firebase deploy</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						Assuming that you've created your <code>index.html</code>, you're in the right project directory, <strong>and</strong> you've successfully run <code>firebase init</code>, this should complete successfully.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, run <code>firebase open</code>...
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>whoa!</h3>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/0tlqT2F.gif" alt="" />
					<p>
						you now have a page on The Internet!
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						You can <code>firebase deploy</code> whenever you want, but you don't have to every time. For this class, you can just keep refreshing the <code>index.html</code> that you've already opened in the browser from your local machine.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Cool! Now let's build an app!</h3>
					<p>
						We're going to build a <strong>Your Favorite Quotes</strong> app!
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						For me, it's going to be an Adventure Time Quotes app, just because I love Adventure Time sooooo much.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Here's what your app will look like at the end:
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://mathematical.firebaseapp.com" target="_blank">mathematical.firebaseapp.com</a>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>First things first</h3>
					<p>
						Go back to your <code>index.html</code> and replace it with:
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code>&lt;h1&gt;Adventure time quotes!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is where our quote goes&lt;/p&gt;</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						This defines two things:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> defines a "Heading 1" for our app. We'll just have this be the title of our app.</li>
						<li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code> defines a "paragraph" tag. This will be where our app displays my favorite quote!</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						At the end of <code>index.html</code>, let's include a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
					</p>
					<p>
						<pre>
						<code>&lt;script&gt;
	// our code is going to go here
&lt;/script&gt;</code>
					</pre>
					</p>
					<p>
						The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag tells the browser, "There's JavaScript in here!"
					</p>
					<p>
						JavaScript is what we use to manipulate content on the page.
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>//</code> defines a JavaScript comment.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Let's include some quotes that we like as an <strong>Array</strong> of <strong>String</strong>s in our <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.
					</p>
					<pre>
		<code>&lt;script&gt;
	var quotes = [&quot;Mathematical!&quot;,
			&quot;Whoa! Algebraic!&quot;,
			&quot;Rhombus! Iceclops!&quot;,
			&quot;Seriously, Stanley... For a watermelon, you get into trouble way more often than you should.&quot;,
			&quot;I keep finding baby shoes. What the heck, man? And they're all lefties!&quot;,
			&quot;I have pants! Spun from spider webs... by pixies.&quot;,
			&quot;I wanna help you outta this, man, but she scares the filling outta my doughnut!&quot;,
			&quot;The bazooka goblin has you in its sights!&quot;,
			&quot;Dude, suckin' at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something.&quot;
	]
&lt;/script&gt;</code>
	</pre>
					<p>
						Here, we're defining a new (untyped) variable called <code>quotes</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						We're setting <code>quotes</code> equal to an array (using square brackets, <code>[]</code>) of strings (using quotation marks <code>&quot;&quot;</code>)
					</p>
					<p>
						Don't forget commas after each element!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Now, let's find the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag, and replace its contents with an element selected at random from our array of quotes.
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code data-trim data-noescape>&lt;script&gt;
	var quotes = [&quot;Mathematical!&quot;,
		&quot;Whoa! Algebraic!&quot;,
		&quot;Rhombus! Iceclops!&quot;,
		&quot;Seriously, Stanley... For a watermelon, you get into trouble way more often than you should.&quot;,
		&quot;I keep finding baby shoes. What the heck, man? And they're all lefties!&quot;,
		&quot;I have pants! Spun from spider webs... by pixies.&quot;,
		&quot;I wanna help you outta this, man, but she scares the filling outta my doughnut!&quot;,
		&quot;The bazooka goblin has you in its sights!&quot;,
		&quot;Dude, suckin' at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something.&quot;
	]
	document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0].innerHTML =
		quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)]
&lt;/script&gt;</code>
				</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>whoa whoa whoa</h3>
					<p>
						Okay, let's work through this line:
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code>document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0].innerHTML =
	quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)]</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						<code>document</code> is an <strong>object</strong> that the browser provides to us. It's got lots of different methods and variables.
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>getElementsByTagName</code> is a <strong>method</strong> of <code>document</code> that takes a <strong>string</strong> as an argument (in this case, the <strong>tag name</strong> that we're looking for) and returns an <strong>array of
							HTML elements (objects)</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						more <strong>document</strong>-ation on <code>document</code> <span class="muted">(ha, get it?)</span>: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document</a>
					</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
					<code>document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0].innerHTML =
	quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)]</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						<code>[0]</code> is a reference to the first element (the element at index 0) of the array produced by <code>document.getElementsByTagName('p')</code>. In this case, that array only has a length of 1, but if there were more <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
						tags on the page, it would be larger.
					</p>
					<p>
						<code>innerHTML</code> is a reference to the actual content of the element that we've referenced in <code>getElementsByTagName</code>. It's got lots more variables and methods, like <code>children</code> and <code>hasAttribute()</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's the <strong>element</strong>-ary documentation on Elements: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element</a>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<pre>
					<code>document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0].innerHTML =
	quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)]</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						Finally, we pick a quote at random, by multiplying a random number (from 0 to 1) by the length of the array, and then flooring the number to get an integer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, let's save and refresh the page...
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/YLNyFaJ.gif" alt="" />
					<p>
						Marvel at your ultimate cosmic power!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>An exercise for the reader:</h3>
					<p>
						See if you can add a <code>button</code> that refreshes the quote <strong>without</strong> refreshing the whole page.
					</p>
					<p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>That's it for today!</h3>
					<p>
						Next time, we're going to do two things:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We're going to have our app call a server to get a quote, instead of hardcoding all our quotes into the app</li>
						<li>We're going to <em>style</em> our app (just a little bit)</li>

					<h3>Anybody want to show off what they built last time?</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						In the previous session, we did some <strong>front end web development</strong> - computation and logic only occurred on the client, or the page within the browser.
					</p>
					<p>
						This session, we're going to have our client call a server and retrieve a quote. This is <strong>back end web development</strong> - the server is going to do the computation (picking a quote at random) and then send the information back to
						the
						client.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						(quick demo of what we're doing today)
					</p>
					<p>
						How is this different from what we did before?
					</p>
					<p>
						Before, every time we sent the HTML over the wire, we'd include all of our quotes in that HTML, resulting in a larger page.
					</p>
					<p>
						This time, we're going to store the quotes on the server, and have a (smaller) page just request one at random every time.
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						Note that this method won't work on Firebase anymore - if you're interested in simple Node.js server hosting, check out <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> or <a href="https://modulus.io/">Modulus.</a>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Question for the class</h3>
					<p>
						Does the client-server model work for mobile apps? What kinds of apps should we use the client-server model for?
					</p>
					<img src="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0jcuyvWwq1rqfhi2o1_250.gif" alt="" />

						What do you guys think of JavaScript so far?
					</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						You know how we can run JavaScript in the browser? We can also run JavaScript in Node.js!
					</p>
					<p>
						Things look a little different between the two: In the browser, you get some builtin variables/objects, like <code>document</code> and <code>window</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						In Node, you get a whole different bunch of builtin variables/objects, like <code>fs</code> and <code>require</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						Node.js is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine: <a href="http://thibaultlaurens.github.io/javascript/2013/04/29/how-the-v8-engine-works/">http://thibaultlaurens.github.io/javascript/2013/04/29/how-the-v8-engine-works/</a>
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						To get a Node.js REPL loop, just run <code>node</code> on the command line. (You can play around with it later)
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Project setup</h3>
					<p>
						On the command line, go back to your project folder, the one that has our <code>index.html</code> in it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Run: <code>npm init</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						This is going to prompt you for a lot of different things; defaults are fine
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Create a new file, <code>index.js</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						Add <code>console.log("asdfasdfasdf");</code> to <code>index.js</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						Try running <code>node index.js</code>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Did your command line output <code>asdfasdfasdf</code>?
					</p>
					<p>
						If so, give yourself a high-five:
					</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Next, we need to set up our Node.js script to "listen" for HTTP requests on our machine.
					</p>
					<p>
						We're going to use a library called Express (<a href="http://expressjs.com/">http://expressjs.com/</a>).
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Installing <strong>Express</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						On the command line, run <code>npm install express --save</code>
					</p>
					<p>
						This installs the <code>express</code> library <strong>locally</strong> to our project.
					</p>
					<p class="muted">
						You may notice that a <code>node_modules</code> folder has been created - feel free to explore it, but we won't dive deep into it this session.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Inside of your <code>index.js</code> file, enter:
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code>var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.listen(3000, function () {
	console.log("Listening on port 3000...");
})</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						Now, try running <code>node index.js</code>. What happens? What happens if we try to navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Spoiler alert: Nothing!</h3>
					<p>
						Whoops, we're currently listening for HTTP requests on port 3000, but we're not actually responding to them. Let's fix that!
					</p>
					<p>
						Make a call to the <code>app.get</code> method in your <code>index.js</code>:
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code>var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get("/", function(request, response) {
	response.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html");
})

app.listen(3000, function() {
	console.log("Listening on port 3000...");
})</code>
				</pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Don't forget to restart your script! It's still running the old Node.js script. You'll need to restart it every time you make changes to your <code>index.js</code> file.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then navigate back to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>...
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>
						Hooray!
					</h3>
					<img src="http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-25-fallonelmo.gif" alt="" />
					<p>
						It should show you the <code>index.html</code> file you created earlier!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Next step: AJAX</h3>
					<p>
						We need to have our page (<code>index.html</code>) call our server (our Node.js script) to retrieve the latest quote (using AJAX), and insert the quote into our page.

						AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, but that's not really something that you need to know.

						Back on <code>index.html</code>, let's include jQuery at the <strong>top</strong> of the page.
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code>&lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.2/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						jQuery is a library that wraps a lot of the standard <code>document</code> and <code>element</code> methods, and makes it easier to manipulate the page. <span class="muted">Generally you don't need it for most manipulation, though.</span>

						Aside: The browser exposes a native method for making HTTP requests, called <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>, but it's kind of a pain to use. jQuery wraps it for us, provides some other functionality, and makes it a little easier to use.
					</p>
					<p>
						More info on XMLHttpRequest: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest</a>

						In the <code>script</code> that's at the bottom of our page, replace the contents with:
					</p>
					<pre>
	<code>$.ajax("/random_quote").done(function (data) {
	document.getElementsByTagName('p')[0].innerHTML = data;
})</code>
</pre>
					<p>
						This makes an HTTP request to http://localhost:3000/random_quote, gets a response back, and replaces the contents of the <code>p</code> tag with the data.
					</p>
					<p>
						Literally everything you ever wanted to know about jQuery's <code>ajax</code> method: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/">http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Restart your script, reload the page, and head back on over to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>...

					<h3>Hm. Still not quite working as expected.</h3>
					<img src="http://i.imgur.com/tVjNl.gif" alt="" />
					<p>
						Oh, right! We need to implement <code>/random_quote</code>!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Back in <code>index.js</code>, include:
					</p>
					<p>
						<pre>
						<code>app.get(&quot;/random_quote&quot;, function(request, response) {
	var quotes = [&quot;Mathematical!&quot;,
		&quot;Whoa! Algebraic!&quot;,
		&quot;Rhombus! Iceclops!&quot;,
		&quot;Seriously, Stanley... For a watermelon, you get into trouble way more often than you should.&quot;,
		&quot;I keep finding baby shoes. What the heck, man? And they're all lefties!&quot;,
		&quot;I have pants! Spun from spider webs... by pixies.&quot;,
		&quot;I wanna help you outta this, man, but she scares the filling outta my doughnut!&quot;,
		&quot;The bazooka goblin has you in its sights!&quot;,
		&quot;Dude, suckin' at something is the first step towards being sorta good at something.&quot;
	]
	response.send(quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)])
})</code>
					</pre>
					</p>

						Restart your <code>index.js</code> script, and reload <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>...

						Now, we can make things a little more complicated:
					</p>
					<p>
						A new file, <code>quotes.js</code>
					</p>
					<pre>
					<code>module.exports = ["Mathematical!",
	"Whoa! Algebraic!",
	"Rhombus! Iceclops!",
	"MY HAT IS AWESOME!",
	"I'm hanging the piñatas... They are all around you! Smash the piñatas!",
	"Candy People explode when they get scared?",
	"Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all, \"Four!\"",
	"Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up because of you. Look at my jacked up face!",
	...
]</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						<code>index.js</code>
					</p>
					<pre><code>app.get("/random_quote", function(request, response) {
	var quotes = require("./quotes.js")
	response.send(quotes[Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)])
})</code>

					<h3>An exercise for the reader:</h3>
					<p>
						Include a form where users can submit new quotes to your service, and have those quotes stored in a persistent database (or text file).
